# Automatically retries reports that were interrupted during execution.
#
# Interruptions typically happen during:
# - Pod teardown (Kubernetes deployments, scaling, node maintenance)
# - Process crashes
# - Network partitions that cause heartbeat failures
#
# This job provides automatic recovery without user intervention, while
# respecting a stabilization delay to avoid immediate retries during
# infrastructure instability (e.g., rolling deployments).
#
# @see CheckStaleReportsJob for how reports are marked as interrupted
class RetryInterruptedReportsJob < ApplicationJob

  # Allows pods to stabilize after deployment/scaling events.
