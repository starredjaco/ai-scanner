# Detects crashed/stuck scans via heartbeat timeout detection.
# Replaces PID-based health checking for multi-pod deployment support.
#
# This job checks three conditions:
# 1. Running reports with stale heartbeat_at (process crashed/hung)
# 2. Running reports that never sent a heartbeat (process never started)
# 3. Reports stuck in 'starting' status (process failed to launch)
#
# Interrupted scans (e.g., pod teardown) are marked as 'interrupted' and
# automatically retried by RetryInterruptedReportsJob. Only after exceeding
# MAX_INTERRUPT_RETRIES are they marked as permanently failed.
#
# Works across pods because it only uses database queries, not local PIDs.
#
# @see HeartbeatThread in script/db_notifier.py (sends heartbeats every 30s)
