  # Stops a running scan report.

  # In multi-pod deployments, the scan may be running on a different pod than
  # where this code executes. Instead of using Process.kill (which only works
  # locally), we set the status to :stopped. The Python HeartbeatThread detects
  # this status change during its next heartbeat cycle and self-terminates.
  #
  # Max termination delay: ~30 seconds (HeartbeatThread interval)
