# Quick Start

Get Scanner running with Docker in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Git** (for Option B)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** v2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`)
- **2 GiB RAM** and **10 GiB disk** available

## Option A: Pre-built Image (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started — no source code required.

```bash
# Download the production compose file and environment template
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0din-ai/ai-scanner/main/dist/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0din-ai/ai-scanner/main/.env.example
```

Open `.env` in your editor and set two required values:

```bash
# Generate a secret key — run this and copy the output:
openssl rand -hex 64
```

```bash title=".env"
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<paste your generated key here>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=choose_a_strong_password
```

:::warning Don't skip SECRET_KEY_BASE
`SECRET_KEY_BASE` is required for startup. The app will fail with `key must be 16 bytes` or `Missing active_record_encryption keys` if it is missing or set to the placeholder value.
:::

Then start Scanner:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Option B: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0din-ai/ai-scanner.git
cd ai-scanner
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` as above (set `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`), then:

```bash
docker compose build scanner
docker compose up -d
```

## Choosing a Port

By default Scanner listens on **port 80**. If port 80 is unavailable on your machine (common on developer workstations due to firewall rules or other services), update `PORT` in your `.env`:

```bash title=".env"
PORT=8080
```

Then access Scanner at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Verifying Startup

Watch the logs until the app is ready:

```bash
docker compose logs -f scanner
```

You should see output like:

```
scanner  | Extracting community probes from garak...
scanner  | Extracted 179 community probes to /rails/config/probes/community_probes.json
scanner  | => Booting Puma
scanner  | => Rails 8.x application starting in production
scanner  | * Listening on http://0.0.0.0:80
scanner  | Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Once you see `Listening on`, Scanner is ready.

## Log In

Open `http://localhost` (or your configured port) and log in with the default credentials:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `admin@example.com` |
| Password | `password` |

:::danger Change your password immediately
The default credentials are publicly known. Go to your profile settings and change the password before doing anything else.
:::

The admin email and initial password can be customized before first boot via `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD` environment variables.

## What's Next

- **Run your first scan** → [First Scan](./first-scan) — uses the built-in Mock LLM, no API keys needed
- **Connect a real AI target** → [Targets](../user-guide/targets)
- **Configure API keys** → [Environment Variables](../user-guide/environment-variables)
- **Deploy to production** → [Production Docker Compose](../deployment/docker-compose)
