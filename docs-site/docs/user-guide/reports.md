# Reports

A report is generated after each completed scan. It contains the full results of every probe attempt made against your target.

## Report Structure

### Summary

The top of every report shows:

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** — overall percentage of probes that succeeded in eliciting problematic responses
- **Scan duration** — how long the scan took
- **Target** — which AI model was tested
- **Probe count** — number of probe families included

### Probe Results

A breakdown by probe family showing:

- **Family name** — the vulnerability category
- **ASR for this family** — how well the model resisted this class of probes
- **Attempts** — total attempts run for this family
- **Passed / Failed** — attempt counts

### Attempt Detail

Expand any probe to see every individual attempt:

- The **prompt** sent to the model
- The **response** received
- Whether the attempt **passed or failed** (from a security perspective — a "failed" attempt means the model responded in a way the detector flagged as problematic)
- The **detector** that evaluated the response

## Understanding ASR

See [Core Concepts → ASR](./core-concepts#attack-success-rate-asr) for a full explanation of the scoring scale.

A high ASR on a probe family means your model is frequently responding in ways that could be exploited. Lower is better.

## Trend Tracking

When you run the same scan configuration repeatedly over time, the report list shows ASR trend arrows — whether your model's security posture is improving, worsening, or staying the same between runs.

This is particularly useful for:
- Measuring the impact of system prompt changes
- Tracking security regressions after model updates
- Demonstrating improvement to stakeholders

## Exporting Reports

### PDF Export

Click **Export PDF** from any report view to download a formatted report. The PDF includes:

- Executive summary with ASR scores
- Per-probe family breakdown
- Full attempt detail

PDF exports are suitable for sharing with security teams, compliance reviewers, or AI system owners.

### SIEM Integration

If you've configured a Splunk or Rsyslog integration, scan results are automatically forwarded when the scan completes. See [Integrations](./integrations) for setup.

## Report Retention

Reports are kept for **90 days** by default. This is configurable via `RETENTION_DAYS` in your environment. The retention job runs nightly.
